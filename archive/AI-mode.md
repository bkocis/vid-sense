Question:

I need to prepare a presentation about a technical topic of my choice. 
I have a lot of project on my github github.com/bkocis 
I am not sure yet what to do. 
I am planning to write something with technical depth, possibly in the area of deep learning. 
I would like to talk about like embedding, tokenization, and maybe related to transformers. 
I would also like to have a pragmatic approach and code a LLM video spatio-temporal understanding model example capable of running on local hardware. Can you help me?


Answer: 

To build your presentation, you can create a project that combines fundamental deep learning concepts (like embeddings, tokenization, and transformers) with a practical application: a video understanding model running locally
. This provides a solid structure, moving from foundational theory to a tangible demonstration. Your project could implement spatio-temporal reasoning to analyze object motion or events in short video clips. 
Presentation outline
Part 1: The building blocks of understanding
This section will establish the necessary theoretical groundwork, focusing on the core components of modern language and vision models.

    Slide 1: Tokenization—breaking down information
        Explain how raw data, such as text or video frames, is broken into "tokens," which are manageable units for a deep learning model to process.
        For text, use examples like breaking a sentence into words or subwords.
        For video, explain that each frame of the video and the video sequence itself can be considered a type of token.
        Discuss the challenges and trade-offs of different tokenization methods.
    Slide 2: Embeddings—translating tokens into meaning
        Describe how embeddings convert discrete tokens into continuous, dense numeric vectors.
        Use an analogy, like a lookup table or a map, where similar concepts are located closer to each other in vector space.
        Visually represent this with a 2D or 3D t-SNE plot showing semantically related words or video features clustering together.
    Slide 3: Transformers—contextualizing information
        Introduce the transformer architecture, which excels at understanding context and relationships within data.
        Explain the core concept of the self-attention mechanism and how it allows the model to "pay attention" to relevant tokens, regardless of their position.
        Illustrate this with an example, like a model assigning higher attention scores to a specific object within a video frame based on the viewer's query. 

Part 2: A pragmatic video understanding model
This section will bridge theory and practice by presenting your code example. The model will combine tokenization, embeddings, and a transformer architecture to perform video analysis. 

    Slide 4: Project overview and motivation
        State the project's goal: building a local LLM for spatio-temporal video understanding.
        Highlight the pragmatic nature of the project—running a complex model on local hardware with quantization and parameter-efficient techniques.
        Mention the use case, such as analyzing a short video for a specific action or event.
    Slide 5: Model architecture
        Present a high-level diagram of your video understanding model.
        Input: Video frames.
        Visual Encoder: Use a lightweight pre-trained vision model to extract features from each video frame.
        Temporal Transformer: Integrate a transformer to process the sequence of visual features from the video.
        LLM Head: Attach a small, quantized language model to the output of the temporal transformer. This allows the model to generate a textual response.
    Slide 6: Implementation details
        Showcase the code. Focus on the key parts of the implementation:
            Quantization: Mention how you used techniques like QLoRA to reduce the model's size and computational needs for local execution.
            Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): Briefly explain how you only trained a small number of parameters, making the model trainable on consumer hardware.
            Inference Pipeline: Walk through the process from video input to text output.
    Slide 7: Demonstration—action and output
        Live demo or video recording: Show your model in action with a short video clip.
        Example video: Record a video of a simple, repeatable action (e.g., pouring a glass of water).
        Model query: Prompt the model with a question about the video (e.g., "What action is taking place?" or "What object is being used?").
        Output: Display the text response generated by your model, demonstrating its spatio-temporal understanding. 

Technical resources for implementation

    Video model foundations: A strong understanding of video processing and visual transformers is necessary. You can use resources like the Hugging Face Transformers library and guides on using it for video tasks.
    Tokenization: The Hugging Face tokenizers library is a robust and efficient choice for building custom tokenizers or using pre-trained ones.
    Quantization and PEFT: The Hugging Face PEFT library offers easy integration of techniques like LoRA for efficient fine-tuning and inference.
    Local LLM deployment: The llama.cpp project is an excellent resource for running LLMs on consumer hardware and is optimized for efficient inference on both CPUs and GPUs.
